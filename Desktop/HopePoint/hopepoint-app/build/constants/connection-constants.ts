The bike kitchen was started to help our homeless community. Every 3rd Thursday a group of volunteers takes bike locks, parts and tools to the riverbottoms and set up our own bike repair shop. It’s a way to not only help our homeless community but build relationships with some amazing people. Visit our <a class="link" href="missions/project-hope">Project Hope Page</a> for more information.'
