      "<strong>We believe</strong> that man is born with a fallen nature, and is, therefore, inclined to evil, and that continually.",
      "<strong>We believe</strong> that the finally impenitent are hopelessly and eternally lost.",
      "<strong>We believe</strong> that the atonement through Jesus Christ is for the whole human race; and that whosoever repents and believes on the Lord Jesus Christ is justified and regenerated and saved from the dominion of sin.",
      "<strong>We believe</strong> that believers are to be sanctified wholly, subsequent to regeneration, through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "<strong>We believe</strong> that the Holy Spirit bears witness to the new birth, and also to the entire sanctification of believers.",
      "<strong>We believe</strong> that our Lord will return, the dead will be raised, and the final judgment will take place."
